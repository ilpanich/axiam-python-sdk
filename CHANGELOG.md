## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Declarative authorization helpers (CONTRACT.md §11): `require_access` /
  `require_role` for FastAPI (`axiam_sdk.fastapi`, async, takes
  `AsyncAxiamClient`) and Django (`axiam_sdk.django.decorators`, new module,
  sync `AxiamClient` with async-view support). Both compose strictly on top
  of the existing §10 authentication guards, check the authenticated
  request's caller (`subject_id`) rather than the SDK client's own identity,
  and fail closed (503) on a transport failure while calling the authz
  endpoint. `AxiamClient.check_access`/`AsyncAxiamClient.check_access` gained
  an additive `subject_id` keyword argument (CONTRACT.md §11.2) alongside
  their unchanged existing signatures.
- Conformance statement updated to CONTRACT.md §1–§11.

## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2026-07-15

First alpha release of the official Python client SDK for AXIAM. This is an
early, pre-production preview published to PyPI for evaluation and feedback —
the public API may still change before the beta and stable releases.

> Distributed on PyPI as `1.0.0a1` (the PEP 440 spelling of `1.0.0-alpha`).

### Added

- REST client covering the AXIAM API surface (authentication, authorization
  checks, tenant/user/role/resource management).
- gRPC client for low-latency authorization checks (generated stubs shipped in
  the package; no `protoc` needed by consumers).
- FastAPI and Django integration helpers for guarding application routes.
- Strict TLS by default with no certificate-verification bypass surface.
- Fully type-annotated (`mypy --strict`) with a 100%-documented public API.
- Runnable examples for the common authentication and authorization flows.
